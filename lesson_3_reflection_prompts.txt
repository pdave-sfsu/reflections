When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

    Having a remote repository ensures that there is a backup of all your work.
    It also allows people to work in a team far away from one another.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Pulling manually ensures that you're not interrupted by the work someone else is doing on your branch somewhere else.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you use one instead of another?

    Forks are useful to copy a repository on GitHub to your account if you don't have permission to commit to it.
    Clones are useful to have a local copy of a remote repository.
    Branches are useful to work on experimental feature on a repository.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

    This will let a user know where their local repository lies in relation to the remote repository.
    It also lets the user fetch the remote before they merge it their local branch.
